Greetings! 
My name is Sylvia Pinheiro, I was born in the sunny city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, nowadays a excellence center for Neuroscience in Brazil. During my undergraduate studies, I got fascinated by the interdisciplinarity of that field, one of the great promises of our time. I graduated in Biology by [Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN](www.ufrn.br) in 2012, being involved in Neuroscience research since the 3rd year, in the [Brain Institute](www.neuro.ufrn.br) of UFRN. You can see about it out in the [Projects](__) section of this website.

My concomitant fascination by literature and language conducted me to explore Neuroscience of Language field, inspired by some quite intriguing questions, for instance:  what makes us, human beings, capable of writing? How literacy changed our specie's evolutionary destiny? What's our resemblance with other species regarding communication abilities? Hence, my curiosity in these issues led me to enroll on a M.Sc. in Neuroscience in 2014, in a project investigating ancestral traits of human cognition through graph theory and literature, work available in the [Publications](___) page. 

As a scientist, I wish to research cognitive and molecular mechanisms implicated in communication as a behavior, better understanding the origins of human language and its precusors in nature. I created this website to share my impressions on some themes of my interest, like education, animal behavior, scientific illustration  and, as expected, biology of language! I am either a big enthusiast of science popularization, volunteering in some events and media collaboration. Other extra-academical topics that I like include fiction writing and reading, watercolor art, mythology, learning about other cultures and idioms and travelling when possible.

Hope you enjoy it!
